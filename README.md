Repository for bigdata trendmarketplace team 9 - Real-time prediction for taxi trip durations using AWS

## Business background
In this project, we use AWS services to implement real-time machine learning inference on streming data. The business context in which we will make use of the architechture here is the delivery service industry. 
One clear usecase is for the taxi industry since time is of the essence - be it passengers, drivers, or the company. A crucial aspect of this is estimating the trip duration. Trip duration has many rolling effects â€“ such as demand, pricing, traffic, weather and delays. 
With this real-time inference system, the trip duration prediction would help drivers plan the optimal rides to consider based on the current situation such as traffic and weather, and help customers plan their schedule better. The company can create metrics to monitor the best pricing strategy and balance driver workloads
